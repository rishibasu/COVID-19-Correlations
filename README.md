# COVID-19-Correlations

This was a project from my summer 2020. My preprocessing.R file is an updated version of an open source file from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. More information on their study is found here: https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/covid-pm/home

Preprocessing.R outputs the excel spreadsheet which was imported into MATLAB for visualizations and PCA.
